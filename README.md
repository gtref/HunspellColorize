## Stop-gap "Help Linus with typos" tool

My google-fu failed me, and I couldn't find a simple colorizing pager
that just dealt with basic spelling issues.

This is very much a stop-gap, because the real solution is to teach
uemacs to do it, but I haven't touched that source tree in years and I
wanted to test hunspell on something simpler first.

This is about as simple as it gets, without being _so_ simple that it is
useless.  I can do

    export LESS=-FRSX
    export GIT_PAGER=huncolor

and the result is usable, and works reasonably well together with the
existing git colorization.

And no, this does no context-aware coloring at all.  Pathnames, URLs,
this silly thing doesn't recognize any of that, just looks at things
that might be words.  In US ASCII only. What a crock.
